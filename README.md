# popclip-extensions

This project is a growing collection of **snippets** for [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app/), a macOS app that provides contextual actions for selected text. 

These snippets add extra functionality to PopClip, enabling users to perform specific tasks or integrate with other tools and services directly from the app.

Snippets so far available:
- [SNOMED CT Concept](popclip-snomedID.yaml) - A simple snippet to search for the selected SNOMED CT concept identifier in the SNOMED International Browser
- [SNOMED CT Term Lookup](popclip-snomedTerm.yaml) - Another simple snippt to search the selected text and respond with a JSON response

## How to use snippets

Simply select the text and popclip will ask if you want to install the snippet. Simple. More here - https://www.popclip.app/dev/snippets
